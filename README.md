Use case:
1. Find a playlist.
2. Play most recent song or shuffle.

Finding a playlist is annoying especially if you need to concentrate on something else, like driving a bike. This simple widget will make that use case a little more bearable.

### Goals:
* Keep it simple:
  * Only a few activities, no fragments.
  * Only essential features, no scope creep.
* Get more familiar with Android.
* UI should look quite similar to spotify, so as to make it familiar for users. It should feel more like an extra feature for spotify that a seperate app.
* Easy to use.
